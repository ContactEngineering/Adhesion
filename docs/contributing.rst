Contributing to Adhesion
========================

Code style
----------
Always follow PEP-8_, with the following exception: "One big exception to PEP 8 is our preference of longer line lengths. We’re well into the 21st Century, and we have high-nb_grid_pts computer screens that can fit way more than 79 characters on a screen. Don’t limit lines of code to 79 characters if it means the code looks significantly uglier or is harder to read." (Taken from Django's contributing guidelines_.)

Development branches
--------------------
New features should be developed always in its own branch. When creating your own branch,
please suffix that branch by the year of creation on a description of what is contains.
For example, if you are working on an implementation for line scans and you started that
work in 2018, the branch could be called "18_line_scans".
