Welcome to Adhesion's documentation!
================================
Adhesive Contact mechanics with Python.
This code implements computation of contact geometry and pressure
of a rigid object on a flat elastic half-space.
All calculations assume small deformations;
in that limit, the contact of any two objects of arbitrary
geometry and elastic moduli can be mapped on that of a
rigid on an elastic flat.
