Installation
============

You need Python 3 and [FFTW3_] to run PyCo. All Python dependencies can be installed automatically by invoking

``pip3 install [--user] -r requirements.txt``

in the source directory. PyCo can be installed by invoking

``pip3 install [--user] .``

in the source directoy. The command line parameter --user is optional and leads to a local installation in the current user's `$HOME/.local` directory.
