Usage
=====

The code is documented via Python's documentation strings that can be accesses via the `help` command or by appending a questions mark `?` in ipython/jupyter. There are two command line tools available that may be a good starting point. They are in the `commandline` subdirectory:

- `hard_wall.py`: Command line front end for calculations with hard, impenetrable walls between rigid and elastic flat. This front end exclusively uses Polonsky & Keer's constrained conjugate gradient solver to find the deformation of the substrate under the additional contact constraints. Run `hard_wall.py --help` to get a list of command line options.
- `soft_wall.py`: Command line front end for calculations with soft (possibly adhesive) interactions between rigid and elastic flat. This is a stub rather than a fully featured command line tool that can be used as a starting point for modified script. The present implementation is set up for a solution of Martin MÃ¼ser's contact mechanics challenge.
